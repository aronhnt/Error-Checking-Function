Error Checking Function Usage:
By Aaron Hunt (@aronhnt)

To call the function in your code type 'yourVariableName = errorCheck(1,2,3) ' (minus the apostrophes)
Then inside your brackets you will need:
1) The variable name that you wish to check
2) The type you wish the variable to be (string (str) integer (int) floating    point number (float) etc.)
3) Prompt for the user if the value they enter is not of the correct type.
